# Vertivdemoproject
Write a solution that can generate a one-time password. The inputs are the following two fields: User
Id and DateTime. Every generated password should be valid for up to 30 seconds. The generated
password and the remaining time until the password become invalid must be displayed on a Web
page.
 
Solution will consist of two projects:
-             A Web API project written with .NET Core
-             A front-end part which will consume the API. You can choose between React Js, Angular or
another JavaScript library
 
Guidelines:
-             Your solution will be evaluated based on coding standards, naming conventions, project
structure, quality of the unit tests and the meeting of requirements. 
-             A plus in evaluation will be:     
 Use of dependency injection
 Layered architecture
 Basic unit test
